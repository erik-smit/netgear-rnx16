# netgear-rnx16

Here is some bits and bobs about my use of a Netgear RN516 with Proxmox.  
Mostly involves how to use the non-standard components under Linux.

[oled-PoC](oled-PoC) is my proof-of-concept for the oled in the frontpanel  
[zfs-zed.d-script](zfs-zed.d-script) interfaces zfs zed.d with ledmon  
[lcdproc-RNx16](https://github.com/erik-smit/lcdproc-RNx16) contains my driver for LCDproc for the SSD1306 OLED panel
